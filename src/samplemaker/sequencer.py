Classes to handle custom sequences of shapes (e.g. waveguides).

The concept of sequence
-----------------------

A sequence in `samplemaker` is a list of instructions to be executed in sequence
that act on a drawing state machine.
The machine is initialized with some internal setting and each instruction can 
modify the internal settings of the machine. Moreover, it is expected that
some of the instruction actually return a geometry that is eventually drawn 
on screen, but that is not necessary.

While the above description might sound abstract, the sequencer is nothing more
than a compiler of a short code with user-defined instructions.
It becomes very handy when designing waveguides.

Each instruction is built as a list contaning a text command followed by an arbitrary
number of parameters (or function arguments). 
For example, one simple sequence of commands is

    seq = [['S',3], ['B', 90, 3]]
    
It contains two instructions. The first is the command 'S' with just one argument
and the second is the command 'B' with two arguments.

The sequencer requires the user to provide a set of functions to be called when
the instruction is recognized. For example 'S' can be associated to the 'go straight'
command and a function 

    def S_command(args,state,options):
        # Draw something based on the machine state, options and args.
        seq.state['x']+=args[0] # Modify the state
    
    seq_dictionary=dict()
    seq_dictionary['S']= (1, S_command) # tells the sequencer to call S_command whenever the 'S' instruction is encountered.

The sequencer offers a template-based programming of arbitrary sequences.
In this way, the same sequence can be used with different dictionaries and result
in different geometries that use the same conceptual instructions.

When is this useful? Mostly when using routines that automatically perform 
routing between parts of the design (e.g. waveguide routing). If the function
returns a sequence instead of an actual geometry, the same routing function
can be used for different circuit design platforms.

Additionally, the level of automation in circuit design can be highly improved, as
some functions can be 'smart' and perform specific actions depending on the current
machine state. 

The best way to learn how to master sequencers is to look at the tutorials distributed
with `samplemaker`.
