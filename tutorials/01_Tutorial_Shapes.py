# In this tutorial we start drawing basic shapes 

# Let's import basic stuff
import samplemaker.layout as smlay # used for layout 
import samplemaker.makers as sm # used for drawing

# Create a simple mask layout
themask = smlay.Mask("01_Tutorial_Shapes")

# Let's look at all shapes available:
    
# Rectangles:
# Here we use numkey parameter to place the origin (0,2) at the lower-right corner
# look at the num keypad on the keyboard to identify the corners (5 is center).
# We also set a different layer  
geomE = sm.make_rect(0,2,6,3,numkey=3,layer=2)

# Circles:
# A circle in (10,0) with radius 3 um
geomE += sm.make_circle(10, 0, 3)

# Circles are stored in memory as perfect circles with center and radius.
# But you can convert them to polygons straight away:
# Note that you can specify how many vertices should be used
geomE += sm.make_circle(20, 0, 3, layer=1, to_poly=True,vertices=50)


# Polygons:
# Arbitrary shaped polygons (but avoid self-intersections)
geomE += sm.make_poly([30,40,35,31], [0,-2,8,7]);

# Path:
# Open piece-wise paths with a width
geomE += sm.make_path([50,50,60],[0 ,10,10],1,to_poly=True)
# Note that path objects are created as true GDS PATHS if to_poly is set to False
# The GDS path is not recommended as it might be rendered differently from 
# viewer to viewer. To get a polygon instead use to_poly=True

# Text:
geomE += sm.make_text(70,0,"Hello", 10, 1, numkey=1,to_poly=True)
# As for path, text is created as true GDS TEXT if to_poly is set to False
# You can use GDS TEXT for annotations (e.g. not for actual lithography)
# To create real polygon text, use to_poly=True. Samplemaker uses stencil fonts
# to avoid floating letters in undercut
# A good ratio width/height is 1/10 as in the example above.

# More shapes...

# Rounded rectangle
geomE += sm.make_rounded_rect(0, 20, 10, 5, 1, resolution = 8)
# Creates a rectangle with 1 um radius rounded edges.

# Ellipse
geomE += sm.make_ellipse(15,20,3,2,45,to_poly=True)
# Ellipse centered in (15,20) X-radius=3, Y-radius=2, 45 degree rotation
# As for circles, you can store the ellipses or convert them straight to polygons
# Except for circles, I recommend always setting to_poly=True. Default is false

# Rings
geomE += sm.make_ring(30, 20, 5, 5, 0, 0.5,to_poly=True)
# Same as ellipse, but you can specify a width (0.5 um here).
# Can be used for elliptical rings as well (set two different radii, here it's 5 and 5)

# Arcs
geomE += sm.make_arc(40,20,5,5,0,0.5,0,90,to_poly=True)
# Same as ring, but you can specify an initial and a final angle to only draw a sector (here from 0 to 90 degrees)
# Can be also elliptical arcs

# Width-variable paths
geomE += sm.make_tapered_path([50,55,60],[15,20,23], [1,0.5,2])
# Same as path but allows you to specify a list of widths as third arguments
# the path width is linearly tapered from point to point. Produces a polygon object
    
# This is all you can do with basic samplemaker makers, we are only missing SREF and AREF
# which will be the topic of next tutorial.

# Time to add this to the mask
themask.addToMainCell(geomE)

# Export to GDS
themask.exportGDS()

# Finished!
